# Changelog

All notable changes to the pipeline-orchestrator plugin are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Inline Invariants block in `commands/pipeline.md`**: authoritative list of gate names + hardness that overrides any Grep-loaded content from `references/`. Closes SEC-1 from the v3.3.0 self-test (extraction refactor created an untrusted Grep-loaded surface).
- **`references/gates.md`**: SSOT for the Gate Hardness Taxonomy, the full 15-gate Registry, the Phase Transition Summary template, and the Gate Decision Log JSONL format with its 8 parse/sanitization rules. Extracted from `commands/pipeline.md`.
- **`references/confidence.md`**: SSOT for the confidence score calculation, scoring rules, per-phase update contract, and persistence format. Extracted from `commands/pipeline.md`.
- Glossary entries: `Zero-Context Agent`, `Agent Naming Convention` (adversarial-* ⇒ zero-context; executor-* ⇒ context-aware), and `Residual Risk: LLM Prompt Injection` (defense-in-depth rationale).
- `sentinel-hook.cjs` trust-assumption header comment documenting what the hook protects against and what is out-of-scope (expects controller to provide integrity tokens, file locking, etc.).
- Hook regression tests expanded 31 → 54 assertions: near-miss stdin inputs, type-confusion guards, string/number `schema_version` normalization, `AGENTS` constant block, `runHook` `opts.cwd` isolation.

### Fixed
- **SEC-3**: `sentinel-hook.cjs` now emits `SENTINEL WARN` to stderr on unknown `schema_version` instead of silently allowing. Backwards compatible (still exits 0). Operators now detect version mismatches and state-file corruption.
- **SEC-B3-01 (v3.4.0 self-fix)**: `schema_version` as JSON string (`"1"` vs `1`) no longer bypasses the version check. Normalized via `Number()`.
- **Type-confusion guard**: non-string `subagent_type` (numeric, array, object, null) no longer crashes the hook with `.startsWith()` on a non-string.
- **ARCH-002 (v3.3.0 self-test)**: `commands/pipeline.md` controller self-label `PIPELINE CONTROLLER v3.1` → `v3.3` → `v3.3`/v3.4 chain resolved; label now follows the manifest version.
- **ARCH-003 (v3.3.0 self-test)**: duplicate `Mode:` line in the `final-adversarial-orchestrator` OBSERVABILITY banner removed.
- **RISK-003 (v3.3.0 self-test)**: contradiction between the intensity table and Rule 3 in `final-adversarial-orchestrator.md` resolved — Rule 3 now tracks the table.
- **QUAL-2 (v3.3.0 self-test)**: `Step 2f` label (which lived inside Phase 3) renamed to `Step 3-pre`.
- **ARCH-2 (v3.4.0 self-fix)**: `Step 3b-post` renamed to `Step 3b-pre` because it runs BEFORE `Step 3b` (final-validator).
- **ARCH-1 / QUAL-1 (v3.4.0 self-fix)**: duplicated inline Gate Registry table in `pipeline.md` removed; the extracted SSOT in `references/gates.md` is now the single authoritative source.
- **ARCH-2 (v3.4.0 self-fix)**: dangling "Step 1c" cross-reference in `references/confidence.md` replaced with the step-name-independent "pre-decision validation step."
- **Stale threshold log text**: the stale-state warning previously said `threshold: 60s` but the constant was 300s; the text is now derived from the constant.
- **Test hygiene**: `process.chdir()` replaced with `spawnSync({ cwd })` in tests 6/7 — removes a global side effect that could leak across tests. Subagent type paths centralized in a frozen `AGENTS` constant object.

### Changed
- **Marketplace manifest**: `pipeline-orchestrator` source field `"./"` → pinned `{"source": "url", "url": "..."}` matching the other two plugins in the marketplace. Unpinned ref (commit SHA pinning) is deferred — consistent with marketplace convention.
- **Intensity table in `final-adversarial-orchestrator.md`**: headers translated from mixed PT/EN to pure English (`Disponível`/`Recomendação`/`Intensidade` → `Available`/`Recommendation`/`Intensity`).
- **Trust model (SEC-2)**: `sentinel-hook.cjs` header now documents explicit trust assumption on `sentinel-state.json` and the controller-level mitigations that are out-of-hook-scope. No runtime change; documentation-only.

### Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing pipelines and `subagent_type` paths continue to work. The Grep-redirect pattern in `commands/pipeline.md` means LLM controllers running the skill now perform one extra grep per gate/confidence lookup — negligible at these file sizes.
- `commands/pipeline.md` reduced from 999 → 909 lines (-9%). Remaining size largely comes from the 4-phase flow spec, CRITICAL REMINDERS, and output format templates — extracting those would require coordinated test updates and is deferred.
- Version bump 3.3.0 → 3.4.0 (MINOR): adds new public reference files (`references/gates.md`, `references/confidence.md`) consumed by Grep, plus backwards-compatible hook hardening. Nothing existing was renamed or removed in a breaking way.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **ARCH-003 / ADV-001**: New `adversarial-quality-reviewer` agent (`pipeline-orchestrator:executor:type-specific:adversarial-quality-reviewer`). Context-independent (ZERO prior context) quality-focused reviewer for maintainability, clarity, testability, dead-code detection, and naming. Paired with `adversarial-security-scanner` and `adversarial-architecture-critic` in the `final-adversarial-orchestrator` trio.
- Regression test suite at `.claude/hooks/__tests__/sentinel-hook.test.cjs` — 14 test cases / 31 assertions codifying the public contract of `sentinel-hook.cjs` (bootstrap whitelist, state-file divergence, circuit breaker, stale-state detection, new-agent routing). No external dependencies; runs under vanilla Node.

### Fixed
- **ADV-002**: `final-adversarial-orchestrator` no longer delegates to per-task / per-batch reviewers (`adversarial-batch`, `architecture-reviewer`, `executor-quality-reviewer`) which run WITH context. The three final-review slots now point to the three context-independent adversarial scanners: `adversarial-security-scanner`, `adversarial-architecture-critic`, `adversarial-quality-reviewer`. This eliminates the silent dependency on external-plugin agents (e.g., `code-review:code-reviewer`) that was observed in v3.2.1 when the LLM controller improvised to fill the missing quality slot.
- Architecture diagram in `commands/pipeline.md` updated to name the three final-review agents explicitly.

### Changed
- README Project Structure tree now shows `type-specific/` as 17 domain expert agents (was 16) and documents the four adversarial specialists (coordinator + security + architecture + quality).

### Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing pipelines continue to work. The new agent is only invoked by `final-adversarial-orchestrator`; per-batch review flows are unchanged.
- `sentinel-hook.cjs` source was not modified in this release — the root cause of the v3.2.1 `PreToolUse:Agent` blocked spawns was the spec depending on agents that did not exist, not the hook itself. The hook's narrow scope (intercepting only `pipeline-orchestrator:*` agents) is preserved as intentional.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **ARCH-002**: Corrected ambiguous executor agent count in README Project Structure tree. Line 254 now reads `# 5 + feature-implementer (type-specific/)` instead of `# 6 execution agents`, accurately reflecting that `feature-implementer.md` lives under `executor/type-specific/` for pipeline reuse rather than as a standalone executor.
- **DOC-003**: Aligned README `core/` tree with filesystem — added missing `adversarial-batch` entry (8/8 agents now listed).
- **DOC-004**: Aligned README `quality/` tree with filesystem — removed misplaced `adversarial-batch` (it lives in `core/`), added missing `final-adversarial-orchestrator` (7/7 agents now listed).
- **DOC-005**: Bumped README version badge from `version-3.2.0-blue` to `version-3.2.1-blue` to match the manifest version.
